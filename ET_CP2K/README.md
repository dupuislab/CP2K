### VAB Calculation

Refer to the paper for detailed summary on the results for molecular and periodic systems. <sup>[1]</sup>  

Testcases in this folder show how to setup and run VAB calculation. All the parameters are set as per our knowledge. If further fine tuning is needed for any system please do so and report back the improvements if you can.
The procedure followed is <br />
1. Initial and final charged states are obtained by elongating the bonds around the required site by around 0.15 A and optimizing the geometry within a specific level of theory (HF or DFT or others).<br />
2. Geometries are interpolated between these two states and electronic coupling is calcuated at the halfway point.<br />
3. For most of the runs wavefunctions of already optimized initial and final states are used as initial guess to wherever possible.<br />

 Input section needs to be specified as follows:<br />
Hartree Fock options are a replication of Guidon et al.'s HF section from CP2K manual https://manual.cp2k.org/cp2k-6_1-branch/CP2K_INPUT/FORCE_EVAL/DFT/XC/HF.html
