# CP2K-VAB Calculation
PK Behara, M Dupuis, Electron transfer in extended systems: characterization by periodic density functional theory including the electronic coupling, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2020, Advance Article.(https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C9CP05133C)

Modifications to a cloned verison of CP2K-6.1 to calculate electron coupling matrix element VAB for molecular and periodic solids based on Farazdel & Dupuis work. [Ref. 1]

# New addition - MOA Analysis
Preliminary working version of MOA analysis based on Dupuis et al.'s, Maximal Orbital Analysis of Molecular Wavefunctions, [Ref 2] is included.
